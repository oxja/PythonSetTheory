# PythonSetTheory
Recognises set relations and evaluates logical statements.

#To use, import the library:
> from setRelations import *

#Sets are denoted similarly to lists, with the empty set depicted as []:
> S = ["a", "b", "c", []]

#Define the relation between sets you wish to use, for example ==:
> def Relation(a, b):
>     if a == b:
>         return True
>     return False
