# PythonSetTheory
To use, import the library:

`from setRelations import *`

Sets are defined similarly to lists, with the empty set depicted as []:

`S = ["a", "b", "c", []]`

#Define the relation between sets you wish to use, for example ==:
```
def Relation(a, b):
    if a == b:    
        return True       
    return False
```
